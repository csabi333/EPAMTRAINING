## Notes to solve the homework exercise

For building the layout, I'd recommend checking how is it set on the [index.html](index.html) page.

There you can find a possible solution using `flex-basis` and `width` and relative units.

For tablet and desktop layouts the style of the Home Page under [index.html](index.html) should have a 25% wide navigation section and a 75% wide product list section.

You could use it as a guide to creating the layout of the individual Product Page, having a 30% wide left column for the product images and a 70% wide right column containing the product details.

You could find the design and some additional explanation in the [assets/design](assets/design) folder, try to make something like that.
